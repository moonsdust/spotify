# IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT THIS SCRIPT:
# 1. popularity column is updated frequently by Spotify and there is a chance
# that the results when replicated might be slightly off from what is described
# in the paper if this script is ran.

# 2. If this script does not run it is likely because you need to create a
# Spotify Developer Account and a new app for spotifyr. After doing this,
# call library("usethis") in your console in your RStudio environment,
# call edit_r_environ() to open the .Renviron file and add in the following
# with the values changed to your new app's Client ID and Client Secret, which
# can be found in your new app's settings:

# (Spotify Client ID) SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = 'PUT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE'
# (Spotify Client Secret) SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = 'PUT_YOUR_SECRET_HERE'

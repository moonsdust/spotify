# Characteristics of Top Songs Has Changed from Pandemic Brain: An analysis of songs on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 singles list (2014 to 2023)

## Overview
Music often reflects the current climate of society and there is a growing interest in how hit songs as seen on Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 singles has changed after the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper looks at music characteristics such as tempo, song duration, loudness, and modality of songs from Billboard's Year-End Hot 100 singles list from 2014 to 2023 to reveal patterns and relationships to explain the difference between top songs before 2020 and 2020 onwards. The results show that hit songs from 2020 onwards had become on average shorter, quieter, but slightly faster with the melody of songs being in a major key. These results can support the evaluation of the current emotional state of different populations and improve treatments such as music therapy, however further investigation is needed on the influence of lyrics on different music characteristics.
